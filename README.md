# IMBD_Sentiment_Analysis_Using_RNN_and_LSTM

# Dataset:
The dataset comprises 25,000 movie reviews from IMDB, labeled by sentiment (positive/negative).
Reviews have been preprocessed, and each review is encoded as a sequence of word indices (integers).
The words in the dataset are indexed by overall frequency in the dataset, allowing for quick filtering operations such as: "only consider the top 10,000 most common words, but eliminate the top 20 most common words".
